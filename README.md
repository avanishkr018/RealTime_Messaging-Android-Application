# RealTime_Messaging-Android-Application
Part of the The Realtime® Framework, Realtime Cloud Messaging is a secure, fast and highly scalable cloud-hosted Pub/Sub real-time message broker for web and mobile apps.  If your app has data that needs to be updated in the user’s interface as it changes (e.g. real-time stock quotes or ever changing social news feed) Realtime Messaging is the reliable, easy, unbelievably fast, “works everywhere” solution.
